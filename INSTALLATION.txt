To install the SIMLA4OBS (S4O) application on your PC please follow these steps:

1. Install Python version 3.11 on your computer. As of June 2025, Python version 3.12 and 3.13 do not work due to incompatiblity issues. 
   Version 3.10 and older ones have not been tested.
2. Create a new folder (e.g. on your C: drive) where you want to store your copy of the SIMLA4OBS application
3. Unzip your ZIP'ed SIMLA4OBS package onto the directory you created in step 2
4. In the SIMLA4OBS.py file, edit the assignment of parameter "st.session_state.SIMLA4OBS_PATH" to point to the directory you created in step 2
5. In the SIMLA4OBS.py file, edit the assignment of parameter "st.session_state.SIMLA_HOME" to point to the root directory of your SIMLA installation
6. Make a command prompt window and move to the root of the directory created in step 2
7. From the command prompt, create a Python virtual environment for your SIMLA4OBS application by running the command "python -m venv s4oenv"
8. Activate the virtual Python environment created in step 7 by running the command "s4oenv\Scripts\activate" (Windows) or "source s4oenv/bin/activate" (macOS and Linux)
9. Install all the Python modules that SIMLA4OBS depend on by running the command "pip install -r s4o_requirements.txt"
10. Run the command "streamlit run SIMLA4OBS.py" to start the SIMLA4OBS application, which then should pop up in your default web browser
11. That's it!
